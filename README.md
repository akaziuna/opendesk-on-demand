# opendesk-on-demand

Opendesk on demand is a way to generate personalised files on demand.

This repository currently just contains an html file that demos a limited
service based on a single Autodesk Inventor workstation.

We're working to develop the on-demand service into a scalable online service
that can handle the export and delivery of customised cutting files from a
new customisation interface on the [opendesk.cc](https://www.opendesk.cc)
website.
